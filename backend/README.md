# Backend

A Node.js backend service that integrates with Spotify API to track and visualize users' currently playing tracks on a map.

## üéµ Overview

Backend is the server component of our application that allows users to share their currently playing Spotify tracks on a geographical map. The service handles Spotify authentication, retrieves current track information, and manages user location data through geohashing.


## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Spotify Developer Account (for API credentials)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables (see `.env_sample` file):

```
PORT=ENTER_PORT_HERE

# SPOTIFY API
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=clientid
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=secret
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=uri

# database
DB_USER=admin
DB_PASS=admin
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=music_map_db
DB_PORT=5432
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables (see above)
4. Start the service with Docker:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

### Manual Startup (Development)

```bash
npm run dev
```

## üê≥ Docker

Backend is containerized using Docker and can be easily deployed using Docker Compose.

To run only backend container run inside `/backend`:
